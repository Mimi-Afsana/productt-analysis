        A perfume is a very complex composition of top notes, heart notes and
        base notes. The top notes are the most delicate and do typically not
        last very long. Heart notes tend to be herbal, floral and spice notes
        which last longer than the top notes but you will be able to smell the
        base notes the longest.
